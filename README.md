# P01: Final Project

## Motivation
In a paragraph, explain why you are building this program.

## Purpose
In a single sentence, describe what your program will do.

## Initial Design Plan
Outline the program:
- List all of the classes in the program.
- Include the CRC card for each class.
- Include the main file, which will be calling all of the other code.

NOTE: The initial design plan may not fully reflect your final product, as projects evolve over time.

## Files
List every file in your repository, and briefly summarize what each file contains.

## Summary
You'll complete this part at the end of the project. Provide a brief
summary description of the design and implementation, including how
much your initial design plan evolved, the final result you achieved
and the amount of time you spent as a programmer in accomplishing
these results, including any challenges overcome and innovations that
were not specifically required by the assignment. This should be no
more than three paragraphs.

## Video
You'll complete this part at the end of the project. In this section,
add a publicly available link to a YouTube video which you will create,
demonstrating how to use your program.


## Instructions
Explain how to use your program and/or play your game.

## Errors
You'll complete this part at the end of the project.
Every program has bugs. Use this section to create a bullet list of
all known errors and deficiencies that remain in your code.

## Reflection
You'll complete this part at the end of the project. Write a paragraph
or two of your reactions to the final project.

## References
Throughout this project, you've likely used outside resources.
Reference all ideas or code which are not your own, and describe and
how you integrated the ideas or code into your program. This includes
online sources, people who have helped you, and any other resources that
are not solely your own contribution.
